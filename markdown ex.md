#### A quotation about books

This paragraph introduces a quotation:

> The half-brained creature to whom books are other than living things may see with the eyes of a bat and draw with the fingers of a mole his dullard’s distinction between books and life: those who live the fuller life of a higher animal than he know that books are to poets as much part of that life as pictures are to painters or as music is to musicians, dead matter though they may be to the spiritually still-born children of dirt and dullness who find it possible and natural to live while dead in heart and brain. Marlowe and Shakespeare, Aeschylus and Sappho, do not for us live only on the dusty shelves of libraries. 
— Algernon Charles Swinburne, “Dedicatory Epistle,” Poems, volume 1 (1904).

#### Some poetry, with line breaks

This paragraph introduces the first few lines of Swinburne’s “Anactoria” (1865) a dramatic monologue. The speaker is the Greek poet Sappho, addressing her lover Anactoria:

<p>My life is bitter with thy love; thine eyes<br>
Blind me, thy tresses burn me, thy sharp sighs<br>
Divide my flesh and spirit with soft sound,<br>
And my blood strengthens, and my veins abound.<br>
I pray thee sigh not, speak not, draw not breath;<br>
Let life burn down, and dream it is not death.<br>

#### Computer code

The paragraphs below include computer code, both “inline” code, in which the code appears “inline” with surrounding regular text, and “block” code, in which a larger block of code is set off from the surrounding text.

The following sentences include some inline code. Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed. Here again is the same sentence, but the code is also bolded. Use **`git status`** to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

Here is a block of some Python code:

```
def times_table(n):
    column_width = len(str(n * n)) + 1 for y in range(1, n + 1):
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        print(x * y, end=' ' * (column_width - len(str(x * y))))
    print('')
```


The code was borrowed from https://www.pythonfromtheverybeginning.com/_files/ugd/c52a80_c91162eff1034675a30a9e2b61770df5.pdf.
